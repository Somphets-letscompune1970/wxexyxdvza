So, I just got out of the theater after watching Opus and I'm not sure if my brain is still processing or if it short-circuited somewhere during the second act. Seriously, if someone had told me that this film was like being served a kaleidoscope salad with a side of emotional overload, I might’ve been slightly more prepared—or not. I’m still trying to decide if I'm loving it or if I just need a nap.

First of all, the visuals. My eyes are doing that weird thing where they can't decide if they’ve been dazzled or abused. It's like the director got hold of a rainbow and then shook it vigorously until it spat colors everywhere. Not bad, just, you know, intense. The way they stitched scenes together made me feel like I was bouncing across clouds, but also occasionally falling through them. Kind of like Alice in Wonderland on fast forward, but with more existential dread.

Man, the plot. Calling it a plot feels almost wrong, like trying to catch a slippery eel with chopsticks. Is it art? Is it madness? Maybe it’s an intricate mashup of IKEA assembly instructions in movie form. But somehow, the chaos was kind of... captivating? I might be saying this because I’m sleep-deprived or because I spilled half my popcorn when that random cat jumped out of nowhere, but whatever.

> There’s this character, I think their name is Tristan. Or was it Tristam? Anyway, somewhere around their fourth monologue about the state of human condition while standing on what looked like a pile of oversized typewriter keys, I started to recognize myself in their existential angst. Or maybe I'm projecting. Odd how the metaphorical language wrapped around me like a moth-eaten, yet strangely comforting, scarf.

Another thing — there were moments when dialogue felt like it wanted to be poetry but ended up like one of those motivational posters that people hang in teachers’ lounges. Do I feel motivated? Not sure. Confused? Absolutely.

I know some people might want to download the movie and analyze it frame-by-frame, but I suggest, if your sanity matters to you, just go watch the movie at your own peril and see if you emerge with deep thoughts or just a craving for some ginger tea to settle the chaos. 

In conclusion, Opus might not have stolen my heart, but it definitely borrowed my mind for a couple of hours and, I suspect, left it somewhere in the chaos of its storyline.
